I believe everything works perfectly under all conditions 

I wrote this code myself with inspiration from 
operating systems notes from professor John
Carroll

design descisions 
for ambiguous cases like echo hi >& i perform the fileio redrection like tcsh does on echo hi
but since & is not a valid file it fails with a no such file or directory
for ambiguous case of sort < foo << EOF I keep track of how many times input is being redirected
and report error if < and << are in a command i send a dont fork flag and report an error 
"ambiguous input" like tcsh
for cases like echo hi >| i report a "null command" error and dont fork 
also for << f1 i report a "null command" error and dont fork
also for echo hey << i report a "null command" error and dont fork
for bad variables like echo $badvar i dont fork and report "Undefined variable badvar" 
for tilde failure like ~blah i report "undefined user: blah"
